<section>
    <p> In this section, I selected an image from a news article that showed a bar chart of Obamacare enrollment, as seen below:</p>
    <img src="cc4_obamacare_badchart.png" alt="Obamacare Enrollment" width="600">
    <p>The image above contains several elements that could potentially mislead the audience, including:</p>
    <p> - The X-axis does not start from zero, which exaggerates the gap between the current enrollment as of March 27 and the target for March 31.</p>
    <p>- The target number is also misleading, as it was revised from 7 million to 6 million a year prior, a figure that has already been reached according to the data. While this may not directly relate to the chart, it underscores the importance of accurate data and thoughtful data visualization.</p>
    <p>Below is the revised version of the chart I created without adjusting the target from 7 million to 6 million enrollment:</p>

        <p>This regression chart illustrates the relationship between regional minimum wage (x-axis) and FDI inflow (y-axis) across Indonesia's provinces in 2022. While the fitted regression line shows a slight negative trend, many data points (dots) are scattered far from the line, indicating significant variation in FDI inflow that cannot be fully explained by regional minimum wage alone. The chart also incorporates a zoom-in and zoom-out feature, enabling more detailed exploration of data points by scrolling.</p>
