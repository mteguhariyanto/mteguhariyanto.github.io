        <h1>Unveiling the Impact of Special Economic Zones on Foreign Direct Investment in Indonesia</h1>

        <div class="toggle-box-header">Overview and Key Insights</div>
        <div class="toggle-box-content">
            <h4>Aims</h4>
            <p>The project aims to explore the relationship between the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and their impact on attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Indonesia. It examines various factors, including the sectors targeted by SEZs, the number of SEZs established, their geographic locations, and potential confounding indicators such as GRP growth, population, road density, and regional minimum wage, to provide a comprehensive analysis of their influence on FDI inflows.</p>

            <h4>Data</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>FDI data in the ASEAN region gathered from the World Bank API and processed using phyton.</li>
                <li>Provincial data on FDI inflow from the Ministry of Investment of Indonesia and National Statistics Bureau of Indonesia.</li>
                <li>Data on SEZ locations from SEZ Indonesia.</li>
                <li>Economic and infrastructure indicators from the National Statistics Bureau of Indonesia.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <ul>
                <p>Data Cleaning:</p>
                <li>Processing Data using Phyton: I used the World Bank API to collect ASEAN FDI data and processed it using Python (link provided in Section 1). The data format was different from what I needed. To address this, I used Pandas to clean and transform the data according to my requirements.</li>
                <p>Data Analysis:</p>
                <li>Rebasing Data in Section 1: I analyzed FDI as a percentage of GDP for five major ASEAN economies using data from the World Bank API. Since Singapore's figures were significantly higher than others, the chart was difficult to interpret, as Indonesia and other countries appeared cramped in one area. To resolve this, I rebased the chart by creating an index with 1975=100, making the comparison easier to observe.</li>
                <li>Separating Observed Units in Sections 6 and 7: Comparing more than 30 provinces in Indonesia posed a challenge, as overlapping data points (circle plots) made it hard to distinguish observations. To address this, I incorporated a slider in Section 6 and zoom-in/zoom-out tools in Section 7 to allow users to examine the data more effectively.</li>
                <li>Multiple Charts in Section 7: The indicators I used varied greatly in scale, which caused issues when using a dropdown selector for regression analysis. The regression lines didn’t display properly because the x-axis values required specific scaling. To resolve this, I separated the regression analysis for each indicator, ensuring clarity and precision in the results.</li>
                <li>Interactive yearly observation in Section 1, 3, 5, and 6: Additionally, I added a year slider control to enhance interactivity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Conclusions</h4>
            <p>In conclusion, Indonesia's performance in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) relative to its ASEAN peers remains a challenge, with net FDI inflows consistently ranking among the lowest as a percentage of GDP. While the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) was intended to boost FDI inflows at the provincial level, the results have been mixed. Some regions, such as Sulawesi Tengah, experienced significant growth after SEZ implementation, while others, like Sulawesi Utara and Kepulauan Riau, showed modest or inconsistent results. The sectoral focus of SEZs also plays a critical role, with manufacturing-focused SEZs demonstrating stronger FDI inflows compared to those in the tourism sector. This variability suggests that the effectiveness of SEZs depends on local economic conditions, sectoral priorities, and implementation strategies.</p>
            <p>Additionally, other indicators such as GRP growth, population, and infrastructure (measured by road density) show a positive correlation with FDI inflows, highlighting their importance in influencing investment decisions. These factors, which also correlate with SEZ establishment, may act as confounders, complicating the analysis of SEZ effectiveness. While the regression analysis provides insights into these relationships, more sophisticated methods, such as Difference-in-Differences (DiD), are needed to isolate the specific impact of SEZs on FDI inflows. Overall, the findings underscore the need for a nuanced approach to SEZ implementation, considering regional and sectoral dynamics to maximize their impact on attracting FDI.</p>

                    <p>The chart, using data gathered from the World Bank API, compares net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows as a percentage of GDP across five major ASEAN economies—Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. To make Singapore’s significantly higher FDI inflows more comparable with the others, the data has been rebased with 1975 set as 100. This adjustment allows for a clearer analysis of relative trends and variations over time.</p>
                    <p>Indonesia’s net FDI inflow as a percentage of GDP is consistently lower compared to its ASEAN peers throughout the observed period. Thailand and Malaysia exhibit notable fluctuations and periods of growth, while Singapore demonstrates consistently high levels of FDI. In contrast, Indonesia’s FDI inflow as a percentage of GDP has remained relatively stagnant since the rebased period in 1975. This highlights that while Indonesia has attracted some FDI, its performance relative to its economic size has been less dynamic and shows minimal long-term improvement when compared to the other ASEAN nations.</p>

                    <p>Understanding Indonesia's FDI inflow trends is essential to evaluate how government strategies like Special Economic Zones (SEZs) influence investment. This series of data visuals focuses on assessing the impact of SEZs on FDI inflows.</p>
                    <p>The bar chart illustrates Indonesia's FDI inflow trends from 2010 to 2022. In 2010, only DKI Jakarta recorded FDI inflows exceeding USD 5 billion, highlighting its position as the nation's economic hub. Over time, Jawa Barat saw steady growth, consistently attracting over USD 5 billion in FDI for nearly a decade. By 2022, DKI Jakarta’s FDI inflows had decreased, aligning with regions like Banten and Jawa Timur. Meanwhile, Sulawesi Tengah and Maluku Utara experienced significant surges, with Sulawesi Tengah reaching USD 7.5 billion, the highest among all regions in 2022.</p>
                    <p>While regions with SEZs, such as Sulawesi Tengah and Jawa Barat, demonstrated notable FDI growth, the trend is not uniform. Sulawesi Utara and Kepulauan Riau, despite hosting multiple SEZs, recorded relatively modest FDI inflows. This mixed result highlights the need to explore SEZs further, focusing on their implementation and local conditions, to better understand how they contribute to attracting FDI.</p>

In 2022, 19 SEZs were established across the country, showcasing the government's efforts to boost regional investment through these zones.</p>
                    <p>Notably, the majority of SEZs—7 out of 19—are concentrated on Java Island, which has historically been Indonesia's economic powerhouse. However, there is a stark contrast in SEZ distribution across other regions. For instance, only one SEZ is located in Kalimantan, despite its significant natural resource potential, and another single SEZ in Papua, the easternmost region of Indonesia.</p>

                    <p>To gain a deeper understanding of how SEZ establishments correlate with FDI inflows at the provincial level, I created event study visuals for four provinces: Sulawesi Utara, Sulawesi Tengah, Maluku Utara, and Nusa Tenggara Barat. All of these SEZs were established in the same year, 2014, allowing for a focused analysis of trends before and after their introduction.</p>
                    <p>The results reveal varied impacts of SEZs on FDI inflows. In Sulawesi Utara, FDI inflows increased significantly just a year after the SEZ was established, indicating an initial success. However, this momentum could not be sustained, as inflows dropped sharply in the following year. Meanwhile, Nusa Tenggara Barat showed an unusual pattern, with a slight increase in FDI inflows a year after the SEZ was established, followed by a significant decline. These mixed results highlight the need for further analysis to understand the full dynamics of SEZ impacts on FDI inflows.</p>

                    <p>The bar chart highlights how the sectoral focus of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) impacts Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows across provinces in Indonesia. The data categorizes SEZs into three sectors: manufacturing, tourism, and others. Over the years, provinces with SEZs focused on manufacturing experienced a gradual increase in their share of FDI inflows, surpassing the inflows of provinces without SEZs by the end of the observed period. Conversely, provinces with SEZs in the tourism sector continue to attract a smaller share of FDI inflows compared to provinces without SEZs. A key limitation of this analysis is that the data is aggregated at the provincial level, making it difficult to isolate FDI inflows for provinces hosting two or more SEZs.</p>

                    <p>The scatter plot focuses on the relationship between the number of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) established in Indonesian provinces and their respective FDI inflows. The results suggest a mixed impact of SEZs on attracting FDI. In the last two years, most provinces with one SEZ received FDI inflows below USD 3 billion, with only a few surpassing this threshold. Among provinces with two SEZs, one barely reached USD 3 billion, while the other performed poorly, even compared to provinces without any SEZs. Notably, the only province with three SEZs showed a disappointing performance, attracting only around USD 1 billion in FDI inflows.</p>
                    <p>The plot also incorporates population size as the size of each circle, revealing an interesting trend. Provinces with larger populations generally attracted more FDI, suggesting that other factors, such as market size or labor availability, may play a more significant role in influencing FDI inflows than the mere presence of SEZs.</p>

Regression analysis reveals that, except for minimum wage, all other indicators, including the number of SEZs within a province, positively correlate with FDI inflows. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for these factors when analyzing the impact of SEZs on FDI.</p>
                    <p>To assess the potential of these indicators as confounders, I also regressed them on the number of SEZs. Except for road density, the direction of the relationships between these indicators and SEZs aligns with their relationships to FDI inflows. However, proving that an indicator is a confounder requires further analysis using tools such as regression analysis, correlation tests, or causal inference models (e.g., Two-Way Fixed Effects or Difference-in-Differences)</p>
